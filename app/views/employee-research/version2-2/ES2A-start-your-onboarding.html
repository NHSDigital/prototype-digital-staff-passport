                  <p>Your existing Digital Staff Passport already stores your personal details, pre-employment checks and other important information.
                    <br><br>

        </div>
          <p>Once your identity is confirmed by your new trust, you'll receive an access key from the HR team. An access key is a virtual card that allows you to login to your new organisation and collect your digital identity credential. Add this access key to your Microsoft Authenticator app.</p>
          <p>Your registration with your new organisation will then be complete. You'll be able to use your Digital Staff Passport to receive and share credentials with Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals.</p>
