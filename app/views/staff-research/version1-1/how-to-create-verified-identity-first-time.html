          <h2>How to create a verified digital identity </h2>
          <p>You can create your digital identity with either Yoti or Post Office EasyID. These are government-approved smartphone apps for verifying identities. Your digital identity can replace an in-person ID check. </p>
          <p>Yoti and Post Office EasyID are available for both Apple and Android devices. Learn more about <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/guidance-and-support/support-for-staff#digital-id-check:~:text=employee%20portal.-,How%20do%20I%20do%20a%20digital%20ID%20check%3F,-Install%20and%20use">installing and using a digital identity app.</a></p>
          <p>Registering for a digital identity can take up to 20 minutes. It will involve uploading a scan of your: 
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>face, using the front camera of your smartphone </li>
              <li>passport </li>
            </ul> 
          </p>
          <p>Once you have registered, select 'continue' to share your ID with your organisation.  
          </p>
          <br>
        </div>
        <div>
          {{ button({
          "text": "Continue"
          }) }}
        </div>
        <h3>What to do if the verified digital identity does not work </h3>
        <p>The digital identity check may not work for some passports or biometric cards. You'll need to attend an in-person identity check with a member of the organisation's HR team.  
        </p>
        <p>If you change your mind, you can still register for Digital Staff Passport without a digital identity. You'll need to attend an in-person identity check.
