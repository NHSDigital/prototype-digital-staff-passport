          <p>NHS employees can use Digital Staff Passport (DSP) to request, share and review essential information, like employment history, core skills and occupational health. Joining DSP can also make onboarding easier, faster and less repetitive.</p>
          <p>You are signing up for a Digital Staff Passport with Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals. You can <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/digital-staff-passport/registered-trusts ">change the organisation</a> if this is not right.</p>

          <h3>Before you start</h3>
          <p>You will need: 
            <ul>
              <li>your valid passport</li>

              <li>access to your personal email inbox to get a confirmation email from us</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We'll ask you to download either Yoti <b>or</b> Post Office EasyID to your smartphone to set up your digital identity.</p>
          </p>
          <p>If you do not have a valid passport or smartphone, you can verify your identity by attending an in-person check with the HR team at your organisation. You will need another form of photographic ID, such as a driving licence.</p>
