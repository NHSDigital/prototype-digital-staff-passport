          <h2>Before you begin: install your digital wallet</h2>
          <p>You need Microsoft Authenticator, which is a secure digital wallet app. You will need to access the wallet to view all of your credentials.</p>
          <h3>What can you do with a digital wallet?</h3>
          <p>Use a digital wallet on your mobile or tablet devices to receive, store and share your passport credentials.

          <p>Once your NHS Digital Staff Passport is set up, you can easily receive and share credentials each time you
            move to a new organisation.

          <h3>To use Microsoft Authenticator</h3>

            <p>We strongly recommend backing up your digital wallet to the cloud. By doing so, you'll be able to recover your credentials if your phone is lost or stolen.</p>
